						Gogh On! is a collaborative drawing space website that allows users to create custom rooms and use a common drawing space, equipped with an in house messaging system, an array of art tools and the ability to export your drawing post drawing session. This project was created in collaboration with Ataa Amponsah, Amanda Henneberry, Nhu Quynh le, and Ellie Ly.

						Seek Coffee is a logo project created for a hypothetical business. The project first began with the idea of Seek Coffee. Taking into consideration aesthetic and feel for the hypothetical business, I created 10 different iterations of potential logos. Some handdrawn and some made in a software. After creating the logos, Peers reviewed the designs and picked out the ones they liked best; one they felt had a good design and fit the aesthetic I was going for with the business.

					<p>
						From there I honed in on the designs people liked most and expanded on them more. I combined some logos from the first iterations, improved a few others and kept some of the logos the same that people felt were good. The first set of designs were creative, but the second set were a lot cleaner than the first batch. Once again I had peers reflect on these logos and discuss what they liked about the logos. In the end, majority of my peers liked one design and wanted to see how I could expand on that particular logo.
