My first attempt at making a portfolio website

I made this portfolio website during my last year of undergrad. I was fresh out of the creative coding class equipped with nothing but HTML, css and a dream!

My coding skills have gotten a lot better since I made this website. And when updating it recently I lost count of how many times I said 'Yikes' to all the legacy code.

It's time I recreated my portfolio site from scratch but before that, I wanted to start this readme so I could document the evolution of this wee old portfolio website~


TODO: 
- navigate through the commits and try to find each 'version' of this website = document how each version looked!
- right a list of bad things about this website - things I definitely want to avoid, whether it's style or coding practice
- right a list of the good things - things I'm actually proud of and would consider putting into the new portfolio website
